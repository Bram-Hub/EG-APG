prop_logic statements that work and don't

WORKING!:
- Modus Ponens (modus_ponens.txt g.txt)
- Modus Tolens (modus_tolens.txt modus_tolens_goal.txt OR modus_tolens.txt) (can do just the premises because the goal file is the same name but with _goal appended immediately before the .txt)
- p, p&q makes q basic_and.txt g.txt
- propositional logic statements (from handout)
    - ones that work
      - 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,18 (so... 14/20)
    - ones that don't and why
      - missing literal: 8
      - incorrectly formatted (general): 7, 17, 19, 20
      - assertion error: 16
